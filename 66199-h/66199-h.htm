<h3>THE GROANING-BOARD, A STORY OF THE DAYS OF
CHARLES II.</h3>

<p>The English public has ever been distinguished
by an enormous amount of gullibility.</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Ha ha, ha ha! this world doth pass</p>
    <p class="i1">Most merrily I'll be sworn;</p>
    <p>For many an honest Indian ass</p>
    <p class="i1">Goes for an unicorn."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So sung old Thomas Weelkes in the year 1608,
and so echo we in the year 1853! What
with "spirit-rapping," "table-moving," "Chelsea
ghosts," "Aztec children," &amp;c., we shall soon, if
we go on at the same rate, get the reputation of
being past all cure.</p>

<p>In looking over, the other day, a volume in the
Museum, marked MS. Sloane 958., I noticed the
following hand-bill pasted on the first page:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At the sign of the Wool-sack, in Newgate Market,
is to be seen a strange and wonderful thing, which is an
<i>elm board</i>, being touched with a hot iron, doth express
itself as if it were a man dying <i>with groans</i>, and trembling,
to the great admiration of all the hearers. It
hath been presented before the king and his nobles,
and hath given great satisfaction. <i>Vivat Rex.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>At the top of the bill is the king's arms, and the
letters C. R., and in an old hand is written the
date 1682. On the same page is an autograph of
the original possessor of the volume, "Ex libris
Jo. Coniers, Londini, pharmacopol, 1673."</p>

<p>In turning to Malcolm (<i>Anecdotes of the Manners
and Customs of London</i>, 4to. 1811, p. 427.),
we find the following elucidation of this mysterious
exhibition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One of the most curious and ingenious amusements
ever offered to the publick ear was contrived in
the year 1682, when an elm plank was exhibited to the
king and the credulous of London, which being touched
by a hot iron, invariably produced a sound resembling
deep groans. This sensible, and very irritable board,
received numbers of noble visitors; and other boards,
sympathising with their afflicted brother, demonstrated
how much affected they might be by similar means.
The publicans in different parts of the city immediately
applied ignited metal to all the woodwork of their
houses, in hopes of finding sensitive timber; but I do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>{310}</span>
not perceive any were so successful as the landlord of
the Bowman Tavern in Drury Lane, who had a mantle
tree so extremely prompt and loud in its responses,
that the sagacious observers were nearly unanimous in
pronouncing it part of the same trunk which had
afforded the original plank."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The following paragraph is also given by Malcolm
from the <i>Loyal London Mercury</i>, Oct. 4,
1682:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some persons being this week drinking at the
Queen's Arms Tavern, in St. Martin's-le-Grand, in the
kitchen, and having laid the fire-fork in the fire to light
their pipes, accidentally fell a discoursing of the <i>groaning-board</i>,
and what might be the cause of it. One in
the company, having the fork in his hand to light his
pipe, would needs make trial of a long dresser that
stood there, which, upon the first touch, made a great
noise and groaning, more than ever the board that was
showed did; and then they touched it three or four
times, and found it far beyond the other. They all
having seen it, the house is almost filled with spectators
day and night, and any company calling for a glass
of wine may see it; which, in the judgment of all, is
far louder, and makes a longer groan than the other;
which to report, unless seen, would seem incredible."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Among the <i>Bagford Ballads</i> in the Museum
(three vols., under the press-mark 643. m.) is preserved
the following singular broadside upon the
subject, which is now reprinted for the first time:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The extraordinary and long-lived popularity
of the "groaning-board" is fully evinced by the
number of cotemporary allusions: a few will
suffice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary Astell, in her <i>Essay in Defence of
the Female Sex</i>, 1696, speaking of the character of
a "coffee-house politician," observes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He is a mighty listener after prodigies: and never
hears of a whale or a comet, but he apprehends some
sudden revolution in the state, and looks upon a
<i>groaning-board</i>, or a speaking-head, as forerunners of
the day of judgment."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Swift, in his <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, written in the following
year (1697), says of Jack:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He wore a large plaister of artificiall causticks
on his stomach, with the fervor of which he would set
himself a <i>groaning</i> like the famous <i>board</i> upon application
of a red-hot iron."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Steele, in the 44th number of the <i>Tatler</i>, speaking
of Powell, the "puppet showman," says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He has not brains enough to make even wood
speak as it ought to do: and I, that have heard the
<i>groaning-board</i>, can despise all that his puppets shall be
able to speak as long as they live."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So much for the "story" of the <i>groaning-board</i>.
As to "how it was done," we leave the matter
open to the reader's sagacity.</p>

<h3>THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "AWKWARD."</h3>

<p>Most persons who have given their attention to
the formation of words, and have employed their
leisure in endeavouring to trace them to their
source, must have remarked that there are many
words in the English language which show on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>{311}</span>
part of learned philologists, the compilers of dictionaries,
either a strange deficiency in reading, or
a want of acquaintance with the older tongues:
or perhaps, if we must find an excuse for them, a
habit of "nodding."</p>

<p>The word <i>awkward</i> is one of these. Skinner's
account is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ineptus, ἀμφαριστερός, præposterus, ab A.-S. æþerd
perversus; hoc ab <i>æ</i> præp. loquelari negativa privativa,
et <i>weard</i>, versus."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Johnson follows Skinner, interpreting <i>awkward</i>
in the same way, and with the same derivation;
but unfortunately he had met with the little word
<i>awk</i>, and, not caring to inquire into the origin of
it, as it seemed so plain, he explains it as "a barbarous
contraction of <i>awkward</i>," giving the following
example from L'Estrange:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have heard as arrant jingling in the pulpits as
the steeples; and the professors ringing as <i>awk</i> as the
bells to give notice of the conflagration."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now the real state of the case is, that just as
<i>forward</i> and <i>backward</i> are correlatives, so also are
<i>toward</i> and <i>awkward</i>. We speak of a <i>toward</i> child
as one who is quick and ready and apt; while, by
an <i>awkward</i> one, we mean precisely the contrary.
By the former we imply a disposition or readiness
to press on to the mark; by the latter, that which
is averse to it, and fails of the right way. Parallel
instances, though of course not corresponding in
meaning, are found in the Latin <i>adversus</i>, <i>reversus</i>,
<i>inversus</i>, <i>aversus</i>.</p>

<p>The term <i>awkward</i> is compounded of the two
A.-S. words <i>aweg</i> or <i>awæg</i> (which is itself made
up of <i>a</i>, from, and <i>wæg</i>, a way), meaning away,
out: "auferendi vim habet," says Bosworth, of
which we have an instance in <i>aweg weorpan</i>, to
throw away; and <i>weard</i>, toward, as in <i>hamweard</i>,
homewards. We thus have the correlatives <i>to-weard</i>
and <i>aweg-weard</i>, with the same termination,
but with prefixes of exactly opposite meanings.
In the latter word, the prefix would naturally
come to be pronounced as one syllable, and the <i>g</i>
as naturally converted into <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>The propriety of the use of the word <i>awkward</i>
by Shakspeare, in the Second Part of Henry VI.,
Act III. Sc. 2., is thus rendered apparent:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"And twice by awkward wind from England's bank,</p>
    <p>Drove back again," &amp;c.,</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><i>i.e.</i> untoward wind, or contrary: an epithet which
editors, while they thought it required an apology,
have been unable to explain rightly.</p>

<p>With regard to the word <i>awk</i>, I can only say
that it is one of very unfrequent occurrence; I
have met with it but once in the course of my
own reading, so that I am unable to confirm my
view as fully as I could wish; still, that one instance
seems, as far as it goes, satisfactory enough:
it occurs in Golding's translation of Ovid's <i>Metam.</i>,
London, 1567, fol. 177. p. 2.:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"She sprincled us with bitter jewce of uncouth herbes, and strake</p>
    <p>The <i>awk</i> end of her charmed rod uppon our heads, and spake</p>
    <p>Woordes to the former contrarie," &amp;c.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The <i>awk</i> end here is, of course, the wrong end,
that which was not <i>towards</i> them.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." may
have met with other instances of the usage of the
word. It does not occur in Chaucer nor (I am
pretty sure) in Gower.</p>

<h3>BALE MSS., REFERRED TO IN TANNER'S "BIBLIOTHECA
BRITANNICO-HIBERNICA."</h3>

<p>Most persons who consult this laborious and
useful work will probably have been struck and
puzzled by the frequent occurrence of two references
given by the Bishop as his authorities,
namely, "MS. Bal. Sloan." and "MS. Bal. Glynn."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>{312}</span>
To answer, therefore (by anticipation), a Query
very likely to be made on this subject, I have to
state, that by "MS. Bal. Sloan." Tanner refers to
a manuscript work in two volumes, in Bale's handwriting,
formerly in Sir Hans Sloane's collection,
and numbered 287, but presented by him to the
Bodleian Library; as appears by a letter from
Hearne to Baker (in MS. Harl. 7031. f. 142.),
dated August 6, 1715, in which he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have <i>Bale's accounts of the Carmelites</i>, in two
volumes, being not long since given to our public
library by Dr. Sloane."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the original MS. Sloane Catalogue, the work
was thus entered: <i>Joannes Balæus de sanctis et
illustribus viris Ordinis Carmelitarum, et eorum
Scriptis: Joannis Balæi Annales Carmelitarum</i>.
Another volume, partly, if not wholly, in Bale's
handwriting, relative to the Carmelite Order,
existed formerly in the Cottonian Library, under
the press-mark Otho, D. <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span>, but was almost entirely
destroyed in the fire which took place in
1731.</p>

<p>By "MS. Bal. Glynn.," or (as more fully referred
to under "Adamus Carthusiensis") "MS.
Bale penes D. Will. Glynn.," Tanner undoubtedly
means a printed copy of Bale's <i>Scriptorum Illustrium
Majoris Brytanniæ Catalogus</i>, with marginal
notes in manuscript (probably by Bale himself)
which was preserved in the library of Sir William
Glynne, Bart., of Anbrosden. I learn this from
Tanner's original Memoranda for his <i>Bibliotheca</i>,
preserved in the Additional MSS. 6261. 6262.,
British Museum; in the former of which, ff. 122&mdash;124.,
is a transcript of the "MS. notæ in margine
Balei, penes D. Will. Glynne." The Glynne MSS.
are described in the <i>Catt. MSS. Angliæ</i>, fol. 1697,
vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 49.; but the copy of Bale, here
mentioned, is not included among them. These
MSS. are said to be preserved at present in the
library of Christ Church College, Oxford; and it
is somewhat singular, that no account of the
MSS. in this college should have been printed,
either in the folio Catalogue of 1697, or in the
valuable Catalogue of the MSS. in the college
libraries recently published. Perhaps some of the
correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." may communicate
information on this head.</p>

<h3>SAMUEL WILLIAMS.</h3>

<p>The obituary of the past week records the death
of Samuel Williams, a self-taught artist, whose
pencil and graver have illustrated very many of
the most popular works during the last forty years,
and to whose productions the modern school of
book-illustrations owes its chief force and character.
Samuel Williams was born Feb. 23, 1788, at
Colchester in Essex; and during his very earliest
years, his self-taught powers were remarkable, as
he could draw or copy with the greatest ease anything
he saw; and he would get up at early dawn,
before the other members of the family were stirring,
to follow the bent of his genius. His boyish
talents attracted much notice, and, had he not
been very diffident, would have brought him before
the world as a painter. In 1802, he was apprenticed
to Mr. J. Marsden, a printer in Colchester,
and thenceforward his pencil was destined
to be employed in illustrating books. Whilst yet
a lad, he etched on copper a frontispiece to a brochure
entitled the <i>Coggeshall Volunteers</i>; and
this was a remarkable production, as he had never
seen etching or engraving on copper; and he
about the same time taught himself engraving on
wood, executing numerous little cuts for Mr.
Marsden: amongst others, a frontispiece to a
<i>History of Colchester</i>. So much was his talent
seen by parties calling at his employer's, that Mr.
Crosby, a publisher of some note in his day, promised
that, when his apprenticeship ended, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>{313}</span>
should draw and engrave for him a natural history;
and this promise was faithfully performed,
and a series of three hundred cuts given to him
immediately. Besides these, he executed numerous
commissions for Mozley, Darton and Harvey,
Arliss's <i>Pocket Magazine</i>, and other works; in all
which a strong natural feeling and vigorous drawing
were leading characteristics.</p>

<p>In 1809 he visited London for a short time, and
returned to Colchester; and resided there till 1819,
when he settled in London. In 1822, Mr. C.
Whittingham published an edition of <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, the illustrations to which are drawn and
engraved by the subject of this notice; and the
freedom of handling, as compared with cotemporary
works, was conspicuous. After these, Trimmer's
<i>Natural History</i>, published by Whittingham;
the illustrations to Wiffin's <i>Garcilasso de la Vega</i>;
and other works, showed his talents as a designer
as well as engraver.</p>

<p>In 1825, William Hone started his <i>Every-Day
Book</i>, employing Mr. Williams to make the drawings
for the "Months," and other illustrations; and
the peculiar style, like pen-and-ink sketches, attracted
much notice, the freedom and ease of these
drawings being greatly admired; and some of our
present artists confess to having been first taught
by copying the free off-hand sketches in Hone's
<i>Every-Day Book</i>. A second volume followed in
1846, and the <i>Table Book</i> in 1847; in 1848 the
<i>Olio</i> was published, and afterwards the <i>Parterre</i>;
both works remarkable for their spirited illustrations.
Several of the engravings to the <i>London
Stage</i>, 1847, displayed great variety of expression
in the figures and faces. Howitt's <i>Rural Life of
England</i>, Selby's <i>Forest Trees</i>, Thomson's <i>Seasons</i>
(the edition published by Bogue), Miller's
<i>Pictures of Country Life</i>, all drawn and engraved
by him, exhibit exquisite rural "bits," in which,
like Bewick, Samuel Williams could express with
the graver the touch of his pencil, thus far excelling
his cotemporaries. The <i>Memorials of the
Martyrs</i> was the last work on which he exercised
his double skill. Of works not drawn by himself,
Wiffin's <i>Tasso</i> shows some of his best efforts; but
as for years past he had been engaged on most of the
best works of the day, it is impossible to specify all.
Had he devoted his time to painting, which the
constant employment with pencil and graver
prevented, he would have taken high rank as a
painter of rural life, as his pictures of "Sketching
a Countryman," and "Interior of a Blacksmith's
Shop," exhibited in the Royal Academy when at
Somerset House, testify, as they are marked by
perfect drawing and admirable expression. Some
miniatures on ivory, painted in his very youthful
days, are marvellous for close manipulation and
correct likeness. After a long and painful illness,
borne with great fortitude, Mr. Williams expired
on the 19th September, his wife having predeceased
him not quite six weeks, leaving behind
him four sons.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>On a Passage in the Second Part of Henry IV.&mdash;The
Death of Falstaff.</i>&mdash;I have read with
much pleasure your very temperate remarks on
the fiery contributions of some of your correspondents;
and I trust that, after so gentle a
rebuke from certainly the most good-natured
Editor living, all will henceforth go "merry as a
marriage bell." Amongst the lore that I have
picked up since my first acquaintance with
"N. &amp; Q.," is that profound truth,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"'Tis a very good world that we live in:"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>but I must say I think it would be a very dull
one if we all thought alike; as "N. &amp; Q." would
be a very dull book if it were not seasoned with
differences of opinion, and its pages diversified
with discussions and ingenious argument. And
what can be more agreeable, when, like an animated
conversation, it is conducted with fairness
and good temper?</p>

<p>However, now we are to start fair again; and
to begin with a difference, I must presume to
question a decision of your own which I would
fain see recalled. I believe with you that <span class="sc">Mr.
Collier's</span> <i>Notes and Emendations</i> gives the true
reading of the passage in <i>Henry V.</i>, "on a table
of green frieze," and I, moreover, think that
Theobald's conjecture "and 'a babbled o' green
fields," was worthy of any poet. Theobald was
engaged in the laborious work of minute verbal
correction, and necessarily took an isolated view
of particular passages. Presenting the difficulty
which this passage did, his suggestion was a happy
and poetical thought. But when you say that the
scholiast excelled his author, we must take another
view of the case. The question is not as to
which passage is the most poetical, but which is
most in place; which was the idea most natural to
be expressed. And in this I think you will admit
that Shakspeare's judgment must be deferred to,
and that taking the character of Falstaff, <i>together
with the other circumstances detailed of his death</i>, it
is not natural that he should be represented as
"babbling o' green fields."</p>

<p>You are aware that Fielding, in his <i>Journey
from this World to the next</i>, met with Shakspeare,
who, in answer to a similar question to that put
to Göthe, gave a like answer to the one you report.
This arises in a great measure from the
imperfection of language; the most careful writers
at times express themselves obscurely. But with
regard to Ben Jonson, I should say that, though
neither a mean nor an unfriendly critic, he was
certainly a prejudiced one. He saw Shakspeare
from the conventional-classic point of view, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>{314}</span>
would doubtless have "blotted" much that we
should have regretted submitting to his judgment.
Yet, after all, the anecdote is not according to the
fact. Shakspeare <i>did</i> "blot" thousands of lines,
probably many more than Ben Jonson himself
ever did; and of this we have the best evidence
in whole plays almost re-written. Even in the
single instance rare Ben gives of Shakspeare's incorrectness,
published many years after the latter's
death, the memory or hearing of the former either
were at fault, or the line had been "blotted."</p>

<p>Absolute perfection is, of course, not to be
looked for; there is no such thing in reference to
human affairs, unless it be in constant and unobstructed
growth and development. This is exhibited
in Shakspeare's writing to a degree shown
by no other writer. The shortcomings of Shakspeare
are most evident when he is compared with
himself,&mdash;the earlier with the later writer. But
take his earliest work, so far as can be ascertained,
in its earliest form, and the literature of the age
cannot produce its equal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I knew there was but one way, for his nose was as
sharp as a pen on a table of green frieze."&mdash;<i>Shakspeare
corrected.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Some of the alterations in the manuscript corrections
in <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> old edition of Shakspeare's
plays I agree with, but certainly not in
this one, since we lose much and gain nothing by
it. Shakspeare, in drawing a character such as
Falstaff, loaded with every vice that flesh is heir
to, and yet making him a favourite with the audience,
must have been most anxious respecting
his death, and therefore awakened our sympathy
in his favour. In ushering in the account of the
death-bed scene, he makes Bardolph say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either
in heaven or in hell."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This expression Burns the poet considered the
highest mark of regard that one man could pay to
another, for in his poem on a departed friend, he
says:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"With such as he, where'er he be,</p>
    <p>May I be saved, or damn'd."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Quickly, in describing the scene, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He's in Arthur's (Abraham's) bosom, if ever man
went to Arthur's bosom. 'A made a finer end, and went
away, an it had been any christom child; for after I
saw him fumble with the sheets, and play with flowers,
and smile upon his finger's ends, I knew there was but
one way; for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and 'a
<i>babbled of green fields</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Quickly, after describing the outward signs
of decay and second childishness, tells us he <i>babbled</i>.
Shakspeare, as the only means of gaining
our forgiveness, makes him die in repentance for
his sins, and seems to have had the Twenty-third
Psalm in his mind, where David puts his trust in
God's grace, when amongst other passages it says:
"He maketh me lie down in <i>green pastures</i>," and
further on, "Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me." I have endeavoured to
give you a reason why I prefer the <i>old</i> reading of
the text: if any of your correspondents will give
a better for the <i>new</i>, I shall be glad to see it, as I
am convinced the more we examine into the works
of our wonderful bard, the more we shall be convinced
of his superhuman genius; we are, therefore,
all indebted to <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> for his searching
investigations, as they set us in a reflective mood.</p>

<p class="author">J. B.</p>

<p>Your just remarks on Theobald's "'a babbled
of green fields" recalls to me a note which I find
appended to the passage in the margin of my
Shakspeare,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'A babbled of green fields, <i>i.e.</i> singing snatches of
the 23rd Psalm:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>'In pastures green He feedeth me,' &amp;c.</p>
    <p>'And though I walk e'en at death's door,' &amp;c."</p>
  </div>
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>This note I jotted down in my schoolboy days,
and thirty years' experience at the beds of the
dying only convinces me of its correctness.
Again and again have I heard the same sweet
strains hymned from the lips of the dying, and
soothing with hope the sinking spirit, ay, even of
great and grievous sinners. Indeed, I have come
to stamp it as a sure mark of impending death,
and have said with the dame, "I knew there was
but one way, for 'a babbled of green fields;"
though I trust with different doctrine than her's,
viz. that religion is the business of none but the
dying, and thence, that to talk of religion is a
sure sign of approaching death.</p>

<p>When Falstaff "babbled of green fields," he
was labouring under no "calenture." His heart
was far away amid the early fresh pure scenes of
childhood, and he was babbling forth snatches of
hymns and holy songs, learned on his mother's
knee, and now called up, in his hour of need, to
cheer, as best they might, his parting spirit.
Strange is it that Theobald, when he suggested so
happy an emendation, missed half its beauty and
its real bearing.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole passage it is evident that
Falstaff was ejaculating scraps of long forgotten
hymns and Scripture texts, which were utterly
incomprehensible to those about him. "'A babbled
of green fields,"&mdash;"he cried out of sack,"&mdash;"and
of women,"&mdash;"incarnate,"&mdash;"whore of
Babylon,"&mdash;all suggest holy ejaculations, perverted
by the ignorance of the godless bystanders.</p>

<p>In all Shakspeare there is hardly to be found a
more touching scene, or one more true to nature;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>{315}</span>
it is most graphic and characteristic. The loneliness
of the dying sinner, with none to stand by
him but the godless companions of his riot and
debauchery; the eagerness of the despairing man
to catch at anything of the semblance of hope that
he could recall from the lessons of his childhood,
"He shall feed me in a green pasture," &amp;c.&mdash;then&mdash;ere
he could reach those assuring words, "Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me,
Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me," the miserable
consciousness that it is all too late, "So 'a
cried out God, God, God;"&mdash;then&mdash;the utter want
of religious sympathy in the bystanders, Nym,
Quickly, Bardolph, Boy, in their misinterpretations,
and perverse commentaries on his ejaculations,
just such as we might expect from hearts gorged to
the full with vice and sensuality;&mdash;then&mdash;the redeeming
touch of tenderness in the Dame, beaming
through all her benighted efforts to cheer, in her
own way (awful to think on, the only way known
to her), the last hours of her dear old roysterer,
"Now I, to comfort him, bid him 'a should not
think of God, I hoped there was no need to
trouble himself with any such thoughts yet;" and
the undying fondness with which she upholds his
memory, and will not brook a word of ribaldry, or
what <i>she</i> deems slander, against it, all evidencing
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"The worst of <i>sin</i> had left her woman still."</p>

<p>Surely a scene more characteristic of all the
parties in it, is not to be found in Shakspeare.</p>

<h3>Minor Notes.</h3>

<p><i>Doings of the Calf's Head Club.</i>&mdash;In an old

1735, is the following curious paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thursday (Jan. 29) in the evening a disorder of
a very particular nature happened in Suffolk Street;
'tis said that several young gentlemen of distinction
having met at a house there, calling themselves the
Calf's Head Club; and about seven o'clock a bonfire
being lit up before the door, just when it was in its
height, they brought a calf's head to the window
dressed in a napkin-cap, and after some huzzas, threw
it into the fire. The mob were entertained with strong
beer, and for some time hallooed as well as to best;
but taking a disgust at some healths which were proposed,
grew so outrageous that they broke all the
windows, forced themselves into the house, and would
probably have pulled it down, had not the guards been
sent to prevent further mischief. The damage is computed
at some hundred pounds. The guards were
posted all night in the street for the security of the
neighbourhood."</p>

Moxon (1845). The first two lines are not on the

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>BIRTHPLACE OF GEN. MONK.</h3>

<p>In a clever biographical sketch by M. Guizot,
originally published in a French periodical (the
<i>Revue Française</i>) under the title of "Monk,
Etude Historique," George Monk, first Duke of
Albemarle, is said to have been born on the 6th
of December, 1608, at the manor-house of Potheridge,
the ancient inheritance of his family, in the
county of Devon.</p>

<p>This Potheridge (otherwise Pen-the-ridge) is,
it appears, a village or hamlet situated "on the
ascendant ridge of a small hill," in the parish of
Merton, about four miles south-west of Torrington.
As M. Guizot's statement, in so far as locality is
concerned, seems open to doubt at least, if not
positive exception, I wish to elicit, and place on
record, through the medium of "N. &amp; Q." if I
can, some farther and perhaps more decisive information
on the subject. In opposition to M.
Guizot's authority (whence derived or whatever
it might be), Lysons, in his account of Devonshire
in the <i>Magna Britannia</i>, positively lays the <i>venue</i>
of Monk's birth in the parish of Lancros or
Landcross, near Bideford, confirmatorily alleging
that his baptism took place there on the 11th of
December in the year above mentioned. In
another account, a notice of the Restoration by
M. Riordan de Muscry, appended to Monteth's
<i>History of the Rebellion</i>, he is said to have been
born in Middlesex, an assertion to which (in the
absence of all authority) little value can, of course,
be given. The slightest local investigation, including
a reference to the parochial registers of
Landcross and Merton, would, however, probably
at once solve the difficulty. But for the known
fidelity of Lysons, and the probability of his possessing
superior information on the specific point
at issue over that of M. Guizot, I should be most
reluctant to impeach the accuracy of any statement
of fact, however trifling or minute, emanating
from that distinguished writer. Few indeed there
are, even amongst our own historians, whose claims
on our faith, arising from close and accurate research,
intimate knowledge, clear perception, and
thorough comprehension of the events of that
most eventful period of English history, commencing
with the Revolution of 1640, can (as
manifested in their published works at least) vie
with those of M. Guizot. With some few of the
opinions, interpretations, constructions, and comments
passed or placed by M. Guizot on the life
and actions of Monk in this same "Etude Historique,"
I shall, perhaps (with all deference),
be tempted to deal on some future occasion. An
able translation of the work, from the pen of the
present Lord Wharncliffe, appeared in 1838, the
year immediately succeeding its first publication.
The prefatory observations and valuable notes
there introduced richly illustrate the text of M.
Guizot, whose labours, in this instance, are certainly
not discreditably reflected through the
medium of his English editor. With one expression
of Lord Wharncliffe's, however (in the note
to which this paper chiefly refers), I take leave to
differ, wherein he hints that the question of
Monk's birthplace can have little interest beyond
the limits of the county of Devon, clearly a palpable
error.</p>

<p><i>The Noel Family.</i>-Will any of your readers
be kind enough to give me information on the
following point? About the commencement of
the last century, a Rev. Wm. Noel lived at Ridlington,
county of Rutland: he was rector of that
parish about the year 1745. What relation was
he to the Earl of Gainsborough then living? Was

<p><i>The "Temple Lands" in Scotland.</i>&mdash;I am
anxious to learn some particulars of these lands.
I recollect of reading, some time ago, that the
superiorities of them had been acquired by John
B. Gracie, Esq., W. S. Edinburgh; but whether by
purchase or otherwise, I did not ascertain. Mr.
Gracie died some four or five years ago. Perhaps
some correspondent will favour me with some
information on the subject. In the Justice Street
of Aberdeen, there is a tenement of houses called
Mauchlan or Mauchline Tower Court, which is
said to have belonged to the order. In the
charters of this property, themselves very ancient,
reference is made to another, of about the earliest
date at which the order began to acquire property
in Scotland.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Abredonensis.</span></p>

<p><i>Cottons of Fowey.</i>&mdash;A family of "Cotton" was
settled at Fowey, in Cornwall, in the seventeenth
century. The first name of which I have any
notice is that of Abraham Cotton, who married
at Fowey in 1597. They bore for their arms,
Sable, a chevron between three cotton-hanks, Or
a crescent for difference: crest, a Cornish chough
holding in the beak a cotton-hank proper. William
Cotton, mayor of Plymouth in 1671, was probably
one of this family. The name is not Cornish; and
these Cottons had without doubt migrated at no
distant period from some other part of the kingdom.
Any information relating to the family or
its antecedents will be very gratefully received by</p>

<p class="author">R. W. C.</p>

<p><i>Draught or Draft of Air.</i>&mdash;Will some of your
contributors inform a reader what term or word
may be correctly used to signify the phrase
"current of air" up the flue of a chimney, or
through a room, &amp;c.? The word <i>draught</i> or <i>draft</i>
is generally or universally used; but that signification
is not to be found attached to the word
<i>draught</i> or <i>draft</i> in any dictionary accessible to
the inquirer. The word is used by many English
scientific writers, and was undoubtedly used by
Dr. Franklin to signify a current of air in the flue
of a chimney (see also Ure's <i>Dict.</i>). Yet the word
cannot be found in Johnson or Ogilvie's <i>Imp. Dict.</i>
with this signification. The word "tirage" is also
used by French writers with the above signification;
and though in French dictionaries its
meaning is nearly the same, and nearly as extended
as the English word <i>draught</i> or <i>draft</i>, yet
it cannot be found in the <i>Dict. de l'Acad.</i> to signify
as above.</p>

<p>New York.</p>

<p><i>Admiral Sir Thomas Tyddeman</i> commanded
the squadron sent during the war with the Dutch
in the reign of Charles II. to assist in the capture
of certain richly laden merchant vessels which
had put into Bremen, but (owing to the treachery
of the Danish governor, who instead of acting in
concert with the English, as had been agreed,
opened fire upon them from the town) was unable
to effect his purpose.</p>

<p>After the admiral's return to England, a question
was raised as to his conduct during the engagement;
and some persons went so far as to accuse
him of cowardice; but the Duke of York, who was
then in command of the fleet, entirely freed him
from such charges, and declared that he had acted
with the greatest discretion and bravery in the
whole affair.</p>

<p>He died soon after this, in 1668, according to
Pepys's account, of a broken heart occasioned by
the scandal that had been circulated about him,
and the slight he felt he was suffering from the
Parliament. Perhaps some of your readers can
inform me where I may meet with farther particulars
relating to Admiral Tyddeman. I am particularly
desirous to gain information as to his
family and his descendants; also to learn upon
what occasion he was created a baronet or knight.</p>

<p>I have excluded from my list all those thin
editions of the Prayer Book, which were usually
bound up with Bibles, except in three instances.
The exceptions are these:&mdash;The folio, 1578;
Young's edition, 1633; and that of 1715. Generally
these thin books, which have only references
to the Epistles and Gospels, are of no value whatever.
The exceptions in this list, however, are
important books. The book of 1578 was prepared
by the Puritans, and is so altered that the word
<i>priest</i> does not occur in a single rubric. Young's
book of 1633 is the first Prayer Book printed in
Scotland; and the edition of 1715 is remarkable
for "The Healing," though George I. never attempted
to touch for the king's evil.</p>

<p>Should you deem this list worth printing, I will
send another of <i>occasional forms</i>, now in my possession,
from the reign of Elizabeth to the accession
of the House of Hanover. It may lead others
to do the same, and thus bring to light some forms
not generally known. The Prayer Books and occasional
forms in our public libraries are known
to most persons; but it is important to ascertain
the existence of others in private collections.</p>

<h3>THE CRESCENT.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 196.)</p>

<p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">W. Robson</span>, in asking to
have pointed out "the period at which the crescent
became the standard of Mahometanism," appears
to assume, what is more than doubtful, that it <i>has
been</i>, and still <i>is</i> so. For although "modern poets
and even historians have named it as the antagonistic
standard to the cross," the crescent cannot
be considered as "<i>the</i> standard" of Mahometanism&mdash;emphatically,
much less exclusively&mdash;except
in a poetical and figurative sense. That it is <i>one</i>
among several standards, I admit; it is used by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>{320}</span>
the Turks as an ornament, and probably as a
symbol, of their dominion, or in connexion with
their religion. This may have originated in the
following fact:&mdash;Mahomet, at the introduction of
his religion, said to his followers, who were ignorant
of astronomy, "When you see the new
moon, begin the fast; when you see the moon,
celebrate the Bairam." And at this day, although
the precise time of the lunar changes may be
ascertained from their ephemerides, yet they never
begin either the Ramazan, or the Bairam, till some
have testified that they have seen the new moon.
(Cantemir's <i>History of the Othman Empire</i>, pref.
pp. iv, v.) But the ancient Israelites had precisely
the same custom in commencing <i>their</i> "new moons
and appointed feasts." (See <i>Calmet</i>, art. "Month.")
That which may properly be called the standard
of the Turks, is the <i>Sanjak Cherif</i>, or Standard of
the Prophet. It is of green silk<a name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, preserved in
the treasury with the utmost care, and never
brought out of the seraglio but to be carried to
the army. This banner is supposed by the Turks
to ensure victory, and is the sacred signal to
which they rally. (De Tott's <i>Memoirs</i>, vol. ii.
pp. 2, 3.)</p>

<p>The military ensigns which the grand seignior
bestows on the governors of provinces and other
great men, include the following: 1. The <i>sanjak</i>,
or standard, only distinguished from that of Mahomet
by the colour, one being red and the other
green. 2. The <i>tug</i>, or standard consisting of one,
two, or three horse-tails, according to the dignity
of the office borne by him who receives it. Pachas
of the highest rank are distinguished by three
tails, and the title <i>beglerbeg</i>, or prince of princes.
Those next in rank are the pachas of two tails,
and the beys are honoured but with one. These
tails are not <i>worn</i> by the pachas, but fastened at
the end of a lance, having a gilt handle, and carried
before the pacha, or fixed at the side of his tent.
3. The <i>alem</i> is a large broad standard, which instead
of a spear-head has a silver plate in the
middle, bored in the shape of a <i>crescent or half-moon</i>.
(Cantemir, <i>Hist. Oth. Emp.</i>, p. 10.)</p>

<p>The sultan's barge, with canopy of purple silk,
supported throne-like by four gilt pillars, is
adorned with <i>three gilt candlesticks</i>; and only the
capudan pacha, when going to sea, is allowed to
have similar ornaments, as he is then considered as
<i>deriyá padishahi</i>, emperor of the sea. Even the
vizier is only permitted to display a canopy of
green silk on ivory pillars, but without candlesticks.
(<i>Ib.</i>, p. 424.)</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the crescent holds but a
subordinate position among the ensigns at present
in use among the Turks. As to its history, I
have found no trace of it in connexion with that
of the Crusades. Tasso, in <i>La Gerusalemme Liberata</i>,
mentions "the spread standards" of the
soldan's army "waving to the wind" ("Sparse al
vento ondeggiando ir le bandiere," canto xx.
st. 28.), but he makes no allusion to <i>the crescent</i>.
I have not access to Michaud's <i>Histoire des Croisades</i>,
and shall be glad if your correspondent will
quote the passage to which he has referred. Does
Michaud speak of it as existing <i>at that time</i>?
This does not clearly appear from the reference.
There were several sultans named Mahomet who
reigned in or near the age of the Crusades, two
of the Seljak dynasty; the first the conqueror of
Bagdad, the second cotemporary with Baldwin III.,
king of Jerusalem. In the Carizmian
dynasty, Mahomet I. was cotemporary with
Godfrey, Baldwin I., and Baldwin II.; and Mahomet
II. commenced his reign about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1206.
But the conqueror of Constantinople, Mahomet II.,
was of the Othman dynasty, and lived some centuries
later, the fall of that city having taken
place <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1453. <i>To which</i> of these eras does Michaud
ascribe the use of <i>the crescent</i> for the first
time?</p>

<p>After all, perhaps, the Turkish crescent, like the
modern crown of Western Europe, may be but a
variation of the horn, the ancient symbol of authority,
so often alluded to in the Old Testament.
The <i>two</i> cusps or horns of the crescent, and the
circle of diverging <i>rays</i> in the diadem, suggest
that the variation is simply one of number; and
the derivation is strongly corroborated by etymology.
The Hebrew word ‎ ‏קרן‎‏ (<i>keren</i>) is connected
with, and possibly the original source of,
our two words <i>horn</i> and <i>crown</i>. Its dual (<i>karnaim</i>)
signifies <i>horns</i> or <i>rays</i>, as in Habak. iii. 4.</p>

<p>A fact mentioned by D'Herbelot may have
some connexion with the Turkish crescent. When
the celebrated warrior, Tamugin, whose conquests
preceded those of the Othman dynasty, assumed
in a general assembly of the Moguls and Tartars
the title of <i>Ghenghis Khan</i>, or king of kings, "Il
y ordonna qu'une cornette blanche seroit dorénavant
l'étendart général de ses troupes" (<i>Bibliothèque
Orientale</i>, p. 379.). Thus did the Mogul
conqueror (to use the words of the Psalmist) "lift
up the horn on high." (Psalm lxxv. 5.) About
half a century after the death of Ghengis Khan,
Aladin, Sultan of Iconium, conferred on Othman,
who afterwards founded the Turkish empire, the
<i>tabl alem</i>&mdash;the drum, standards, and other ornaments
of a general. (Cantemir, <i>Hist. Oth. Emp.</i>,
p. 10.) The explanation of the <i>alem</i> by the historian
in his annotations, I have already quoted.
This is the only allusion to the crescent as an ensign
that I have met with in Cantemir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>{321}</span></p>

<p>The painters of Christendom (no high authorities
in this matter) often represent the crescent
as a part of Turkish costume, worn in front of the
turban. But in the portraits of the Turkish emperors,
"taken from originals in the grand seignior's
palace," there appears no such ornament.
(See the plates in Cantemir's <i>History</i>.) Many of
them are represented as wearing the <i>sorgus</i>, a
crest of feathers adorned with precious stones.
Like the horn, it is an emblem of authority.
Many of them have two fastened to the turban.</p>

<p>Your correspondent states that "the crescent is
common upon the reverses of coins of the Eastern
empire long before the Turkish conquest." I
think this highly probable, but would be glad to
see the authorities for the fact. I cannot admit,
however, that the crescent was in any degree
"peculiar to Sclave nations" for, first, the Sclave
nations reached no farther south than Moravia,
Bohemia, and their vicinity, they did not occupy
the seat of the Eastern empire, which was partly
Greek and partly Roman. Secondly, though I
have no work on numismatics to consult, I have
casually met with instances in which the heavenly
bodies are represented on Persian, Phœnician, and
Roman coins. As instances, in Calmet's <i>Dictionary</i>,
art. "Moloch," is represented a Persian
coin with the figures of a star and <i>crescent</i>; in
the Pictorial Bible, 2 Chron. xv. 16., a Phœnician
coin bearing a <i>crescent</i>; and in Matt. xx. 1., on a
Roman coin of Augustus, there is the figure of
a star. The Turks, however, stamp nothing on
their coins but the emperor's name and the date
of coinage.</p>

<p>Again, in European heraldry, Frank, German,
Gothic, and not Sclave, the <i>crescent</i> appears; in
"common charges," for example, as one of the
emblems of power, glory, &amp;c. and among "differences,"
to distinguish a second son.</p>

<p>Should the above facts tend to throw any light
on the subject of your correspondent's inquiry, I
shall be gratified; and if any of my views can be
shown to be erroneous, it will afford me equal
pleasure to correct them.</p>

<p>So says De Tott; Cantemir says it is <i>red</i>. But
this discrepancy in the authorities is easily accounted
for, since the <i>Sanjak Cherif</i> is so sacred that it must
be looked upon by none but the <i>Muslimans</i>, the true
believers. If seen by the eyes of <i>giaours</i> (unbelievers),
it would be profaned. (De Tott, <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 3.)</p>

<h3>SEALS OF THE BOROUGH OF GREAT YARMOUTH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 269.)</p>

<p>I fear that the result of my researches will be
but of little service; but your Querist is heartily
welcome to the mite I offer.</p>

<p>The second seal appears to have been the seal
of assay; probably used for certifying the correctness
of the king's beam, or for sealing documents
authorising exports, of which there were
formerly many and various from this port. Yarmouth
was held by the kings until 9 John, when
a charter was granted to his burgesses, inhabitants
of Gernemue, that they should henceforth hold
the town in "fee-farm," paying yearly the sum of
55<i>l.</i> in lieu of all rents, tolls, &amp;c. Probably on
this occasion a seal of arms was granted. About
the year 1306 a dispute fell out between Great
Yarmouth and the men of Little Yarmouth and
Gorleston adjoining, the latter insisting on the
right to load and unload fish in their harbours;
but the former prevailed as being free burgh,
which the others were not. In 1332 a charter
was granted (6 Ed. III.) for adjusting these disputes,
wherein it was directed&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That ships laden with wool, leather, and skins
upon which the great custom is due, shall clear out
from that port where our beam and the seal called
<i>coket</i> remain, and nowhere else (ubi thronus noster et
sigillum nostrum, quod dicitur <i>coket</i>, existunt, et non
alibi carcentur)."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What <i>coket</i> is, I am unable to say: but the king's
beam for weighing merchandise, called <i>thronus</i> or
<i>tronus</i>, stood usually in the most public place of
the town or port. The legend on this seal appears
to be old French, and is evidently the "seal of
assay of Great Yarmouth."</p>

<p>The third seal has probably belonged to Little
Yarmouth. The arms of Great Yarmouth were
"azure three herrings in pale argent." It is not
unlikely that during disputes between the two
ports the Little Yarmouthites might assume a
seal of arms; but as such thing were more carefully
looked after then than in these degenerate
days, they would not venture on the <i>three
herrings</i>, but content themselves with one; and
they might desire to dignify their town as "New"
instead of "Little" Yarmouth.</p>

<p>With regard to the first seal, I should judge
from its oval shape, the cross, and legend, that it
is ecclesiastic, and has no connexion with Yarmouth.</p>

<h3>MOON SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., pp. 79. 145.)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the authority upon which <span class="sc">Mr.
Ingleby</span> founds the assertion, that there is not the
"slightest observable dependence" between the
moon and the weather, the dictum is open to something
more than doubt. That the popular belief
of a full moon bringing fine weather is not strictly
correct, is undoubted; and the majority of the
popular ideas entertained on the influence of the
moon on the weather are equally fallacious; but
that the moon exerts no influence whatever on the
changes of the weather, is a statement involving
grave errors.</p>

<p>The action of the moon on meteorological processes
is a highly complex problem; but the principal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>{322}</span>
conclusions to which scientific observations
tend, on this matter, may be pointed out without
perhaps encroaching too much on the space of
"N. &amp; Q."</p>

<p>Luke Howard, of Ackworth, several years ago,
concluded, from a series of elaborate observations,
extending over many years, that the moon exerted
a distinct influence on atmospheric pressure: and
Col. Sabine has more recently shown, from observations
made at the British Magnetical and Meteorological
Observatory at St. Helena since 1842&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That the attraction of the moon causes the mercury
in the barometer to stand, on the average, .004 of an
English inch higher when the moon is on the meridian
above or below the pole, than when she is six hours
distant from the meridian."&mdash;<i>Cosmos</i>, vol. i. note 381,
(author. trans.); <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1847, art. v.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Luke Howard farther gives cogent reasons,
from his tabulated observations, for the conclusion
that the moon has an appreciable effect upon the
weather, exerted through the influence of its attraction
on the course and direction of the winds,
upon which it acts as a marked disturbing cause;
and through them it affects the local distribution
of temperature, and the density of the atmosphere.
There is no constant agreement between the <i>phases</i>
of the moon and certain states of the weather; but
an apparent connexion is not unfrequently observed,
due to the prevalence of certain winds,
which would satisfactorily account for the origin
and persistence of the popular belief: for, "it is
the peculiar and perpetual error of the human
understanding to be more moved and excited by
affirmatives than negatives" (<i>Nov. Org.</i>, Aph. 46.).
For example, in 1807, "not a twentieth part of
the rain of the year fell in that quarter of the
whole space, which occurred under the influence
of the moon at full" (<i>Lectures on Meteorology</i>, by
L. Howard, 1837, p. 81.). In 1808, however, this
phase lost this character completely.</p>

<p>A more marked relation is found between the
state of the weather and the <i>declination</i> of the
moon: for&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It would appear, that while the moon is far south of
the equator, there falls but a moderate quantity of rain
with us; that while she is crossing the equator towards
these latitudes, our rain increases; that the
greatest depth of rain falls, with us, in the week in
which she is in the full north declination, or most
nearly vertical to these latitudes; and that during her
return over the equator to the south, the rain is reduced
to its minimum quantity. <i>And this distribution
obtains in very nearly the same proportions both in an extremely
dry and in an extremely wet season.</i>"&mdash;<i>Climate of
London</i>, by L. Howard, vol. ii. p. 251., 1820.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Still more recently, Luke Howard has summed
up the labours of his life on this subject, and he
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have, I think, evidence of a great <i>tidal wave</i>,
or swell in the atmosphere, caused by the moon's attraction,
preceding her in her approach to us, and following
slowly as she departs from these latitudes. Were
the atmosphere a calm fluid ocean of air of uniform
temperature, this tide would be manifested with as
great regularity as those of the ocean of waters. But
the currents uniformly kept up by the sun's varying
influence effectually prevent this, and so complicate
the problem.</p>

<p>"There is also manifest in the lunar influence a
<i>gradation of effects</i>, which is here shown, as it is found
to operate <i>through a cycle of eighteen years</i>. In these
the mean weight of our atmosphere increases through
the forepart of the period; and having kept for a year
at the maximum it has attained, decreases again through
the remaining years to a minimum; about which there
seems to be a fluctuation, before the mean begins to
rise again."&mdash;"On a Cycle of Eighteen Years in the
Height of the Barometer" (<i>Papers on Meteorology</i>,
Part II.; <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1841, Part II.).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It is satisfactory to all interested in this matter
to know that "the incontestable action of our
satellite on atmospheric pressure, aqueous precipitations,
and the dispersion of clouds, will be
treated in the latter and purely telluric portion of
the <i>Cosmos</i>" (vol. iii. p. 368., and note 596, where
an interesting illustration is given of the effects
of the radiation of heat from the moon in the
upper strata of our atmosphere).</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Jno. N. Radcliffe.</span></p>

<p>Dewsbury.</p>

<p>Not being quite satisfied with <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby's</span>
answer to W. W.'s Query, I beg to refer inquirers
to the <i>Nautical Magazine</i> for July, 1850, and three
subsequent months, in which will be found a
translation by Commander L. G. Heath, R.N., of
a paper published by M. Arago in the <i>Annuaire du
Bureau des Longitudes</i> for the year 1833, entitled
"Does the Moon exercise any appreciable Influence
on our Atmosphere?" This treatise enters
fully into the subject, and gives the results of
several courses of experiments extending over
many years; which go to prove that in Germany,
at all events, there is more rain during the waxing
than during the waning moon. Several popular
errors are shown to have arisen in the belief that
certain appearances in the moon, really the <i>effect</i>
of peculiar states of the atmosphere, were the
<i>cause</i> of such atmospheric peculiarities; but we
are allowed some ground for supposing that this
"vulgar error" may have some foundation in
"vulgar truth."</p>

<h3>LATIN RIDDLE.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 243.)</p>

<p>The enigma of Aulus Gellius (<i>Noctes Atticæ</i>,
lib. xii. cap. vi.), though transmitted to us in a
corrupt form, is solved at once by the story mentioned
by Livy (lib. i. cap. lv.). When Tarquinius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>{323}</span>
Superbus was about to build the Temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus, it was found necessary to "exaugurate"
or dispossess the other deities whose
shrines had previously occupied the ground. All
readily gave way to Father Jupiter with the exception
of <i>Terminus</i>; and the point of the riddle
lies in the analogy between "<i>Semel</i> minus," "<i>Bis</i>
minus," and "<i>Ter</i> minus."</p>

<p>I extract a note from the copy of Aulus Gellius
before me:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Barthius (<i>Adv.</i>, lib. xvi. cap. xxii.) hos versus ita
legebat:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>'Semel minus? Non. Bisminus? Non. Sat scio.</p>
    <p>An utrumque? Verum; ut quondam audivi dicier,</p>
    <p>Jovi ipsi regi noluit concedere.'</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Ita et trimetri sua sibi constant lege, et acumen
repetitis interrogatiunculis. Alioquin frigidum responsum.
Potest tamen ita intelligi, ut semel, bis, imo
ter Jove minus sit, et noluerit tamen Jovi cedere."&mdash;Page
560. N.: Lugd. Batav., 1706, 4to.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Lactantius, "the Christian Cicero," thus tells
the story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nam cum Tarquinius Capitolium facere vellet, eoque
in loco multorum deorum sacella essent: consuluit
eos per augurium; utrum Jovi cederent, et cedentibus
cæteris, solus Terminus mansit. Unde illum
Poeta 'Capitoli immobile Saxum' vocat (Virg., <i>Æn.</i>
ix. 441.). Facto itaque Capitolio, supra ipsum Terminum
foramen est in tecto relictum: ut quia non
cesserat, libero cœlo frueretur."&mdash;<i>De Falsa Relig.</i>, lib. i.
cap. xx. <i>ad fin.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Livy, in a subsequent book (v. 45.), Dionysius
of Halicarnassus (<i>Antiqu. Rom.</i>, lib. iii. cap. lxix.)
and Florus assert that <i>Juventas</i> also refused to
move; and St. Augustine tells the same story of
<i>Mars</i>. I may as well quote his words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cum Rex Tarquinius Capitolium fabricare vellet,
eumque locum qui ei dignior aptiorque videbatur, ab
Diis aliis cerneret præoccupatum, non audens aliquid
contra eorum facere arbitrium, et credens eos tanto
numini suoque principi voluntate cessuros; quia multi
erant illic ubi Capitolium constitutum est, per augurium
quæsivit, utrum concedere locum vellent Jovi:
atque ipsi inde cedere omnes voluerunt, præter illos,
quos commemoravi, Martem, Terminum, Juventatem:
atque ideo Capitolium ita constitutum est, ut etiam
iste tres intus essent tam obscuris signis, ut hoc vix
homines doctissimi scirent."&mdash;<i>De Civit. Dei</i>, lib. iv.
cap. xxiii. 3.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nor must I omit the following from Ovid:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>"Quid, nova quum fierent Capitolia? Nempe Deorum</p>

<h3>"HURRAH!"</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 20. &amp;c.)</p>

<p>In two previous Numbers (Vol. vi., p. 54.; Vol.
vii., p. 594.) Queries have been inserted as to the
derivation of the exclamations <i>Hurrah!</i> and <i>Hip,
hip, hurrah!</i> These have elicited much learned
remark (Vol. vii., p. 633.; Vol. viii., pp. 20. 277.),
but still I think the real originals have not yet
been reached by your correspondents.</p>

<p>As to <i>hip, hip!</i> I fear it must remain questionable,
whether it be not a mere fanciful conjecture
to resolve it into the initials of the war-cry of
the Crusaders, "Hierosolyma est perdita!" The
authorities, however, seem to establish that it
should be written "hep" instead of <i>hip</i>. I would
only remark, <i>en passant</i>, that there is an error in
the passage cited by <span class="sc">Mr. Brent</span> (Vol. viii., p. 88.)
in opposition to this mediæval solution, which entirely
destroys the authority of the quotation. He
refers to a note on the ballad of "Old Sir Simon
the King," in which, on the couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"Hang up all the poor <i>hep</i> drinkers,</p>
    <p>Cries Old Sir Sim, the king of skinkers."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>the author says that "<i>hep</i> was a term of derision
applied to those who drank a weak infusion of the
hep (or <i>hip</i>) berry or sloe: and that the exclamation
'hip, hip, hurrah!' is merely a corruption
of 'hip, hip, away!'" But, unfortunately for this
theory, the hip is not the sloe, as the annotator
seems to suppose; nor is it capable of being used
in the preparation of any infusion that could be
substituted for wine, or drunk "with all the
honours." It is merely the hard and tasteless
<i>buckey</i> of the wild dog-rose, to the flower of which
Chaucer likens the gentle knight Sir Thopas:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"As swete as is the bramble flour,</p>
    <p>That beareth, the red <i>hepe</i>."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This demurrer, therefore, does not affect the
validity of the claim which has been set up in
favour of an oriental origin for this convivial
<i>refrain</i>.</p>

<p>As to <i>hurrah!</i> if I be correct in my idea of its
parentage, there are few words still in use which
can boast such a remote and widely extended
prevalence. It is one of those interjections in
which sound so echoes sense, that men seem to
have adopted it almost instinctively. In India
and Ceylon, the Mahouts and attendants of the
baggage-elephants cheer them on by perpetual
repetitions of <i>ur-ré, ur-ré!</i> The Arabs and camel-drivers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>{324}</span>
in Turkey, Palestine, and Egypt encourage
their animals to speed by shouting <i>ar-ré, ar-ré!</i>
The Moors seem to have carried the custom with
them into Spain, where the mules and horses are
still driven with cries of <i>arré</i> (whence the muleteers
derive their Spanish appellation of <i>arrieros</i>).
In France, the sportsman excites the hound by
shouts of <i>hare, hare!</i> and the waggoner turns
his horses by his voice, and the use of the word
<i>hurhaut!</i> In Germany, according to Johnson
(<i>in verbo</i> <span class="sc">Hurry</span>), "<i>Hurs</i> was a word used by
the old Germans in urging their horses to speed."
And to the present day, the herdsmen in Ireland,
and parts of Scotland, drive their cattle with
shouts of <i>hurrish, hurrish!</i> In the latter country,
in fact, to <i>hurry</i>, or to <i>harry</i>, is the popular term
descriptive of the predatory habits of the border
reivers in plundering and "driving the cattle" of
the lowlanders.</p>

<p>The sound is so expressive of excitement and
energy, that it seems to have been adopted in all
nations as a stimulant in times of commotion;
and eventually as a war-cry by the Russians, the
English, and almost every people of Europe. Sir
Francis Palgrave, in the passage quoted from his
<i>History of Normandy</i> ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. viii., p. 20.),
has described the custom of the Normans in
raising the country by "the cry of <i>haro</i>," or <i>haron</i>,
upon which all the lieges were bound to join in
pursuit of the offender. This <i>clameur de haron</i> is
the origin of the English "hue and cry;" and the
word <i>hue</i> itself seems to retain some trace of the
prevailing pedigree.</p>

<p>This stimulating interjection appears, in fact, to
have enriched the French language as well as our
own with some of the most expressive etymologies.
It is the parent of the obsolete French verb <i>harer</i>,
"to hound on, or excite clamour against any one."
And it is to be traced in the epithet for a worn-out
horse, a <i>haridelle</i>, or <i>haridan</i>.</p>

<p>In like manner, our English expressions, to
<i>hurry</i>, to <i>harry</i>, and <i>harass</i> a flying enemy, are all
instinct with the same impulse, and all traceable
to the same root.</p>

<p>The following extract frown Mr. Thos. Dicey's
<i>Hist. of Guernsey</i> (edit. Lond. 1751), pp. 8, 9, 10.,
may be worth adding to the foregoing notes on this
subject:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One thing more relating to <i>Rollo</i> Mr. Falle, in
his account of Jersey, introduces in the following
manner, not only for the singularity of it, but the
particular concern which that island has still in it,
viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whether it began through Rollo's own appointment,
or took its rise among the people from an awful
reverence of him for his justice, it matters not; but so
it is, that a custom obtained in his time, that in case
of incroachment and invasion of property, or of any
other oppression and violence requiring immediate
remedy, the party aggrieved need do no more than call
upon the name of the Duke, though at never so great
a distance, thrice repeating aloud <i>Ha-Ro</i>, &amp;c., and
instantly the aggressor was at his peril to forbear
attempting anything further.&mdash;<i>Aa!</i> or <i>Ha!</i> is the
exclamation of a person suffering; <i>Ro</i> is the Duke's
name abbreviated; so that <i>Ha-Ro</i> is as much as to say,
<i>O! Rollo, my Prince, succour me.</i> Accordingly (says
Mr. Falle) with us, in Jersey, the cry is, <i>Ha-Ro, à
l'aide, mon Prince!</i> And this is that famous <i>Clameur
de Haro</i>, subsisting in practice even when Rollo was
no more, so much praised and commented upon by
all who have wrote on the Norman laws. A notable
example of its virtue and power was seen about one
hundred and seventy years after Rollo's death, at
William the Conqueror's funeral, when, in confidence
thereof, a private man and a subject dared to oppose
the burying of his body, in the following manner:</p>

<p>"It seems that, in order to build the great Abbey of
St. Stephen at Caen, where he intended to lie after his
decease, the Conqueror had caused several houses to
be pulled down for enlarging the area, and amongst
them one whose owner had received no satisfaction for
his loss. The son of that person (others say the person
himself) observing the grave to be dug on that
very spot of ground which had been the site of his
father's house, went boldly into the assembly, and forbid
them, <i>not in the name of God</i>, as some have it, but
<i>in the name of Rollo</i>, to bury the body there.</p>

<p>"Paulus Æmylius, who relates the story, says that
he addressed himself to the company in these words:&mdash;'He
who oppressed kingdoms by his arms has been my
oppressor also, and has kept me under a continual fear
of death. Since I have outlived him who injured me,
I mean not to acquit him now he is dead. The ground
whereon you are going to lay this man is mine; and I
affirm that none may in justice bury their dead in
ground which belongs to another. If, after he is gone,
force and violence are still used to detain my right
from me, <span class="sc">I appeal to Rollo</span>, the founder and father
of our nation, who, though dead, lives in his laws. I
take refuge in those laws, owning no authority above
them.'</p>

<p>"This uncommonly brave speech, spoken in presence
of the deceased king's own son, Prince Henry, afterwards
our King Henry I., wrought its effect: the
<i>Ha-Ro</i> was respected, the man had compensation made
him for his wrongs, and, all opposition ceasing, the
dead king was laid in his grave."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Process for Printing on Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;The
power of obtaining agreeable and well-printed
positives from their negatives being the great object
with all photographers, induces me to communicate
the following mode of preparing albumenized
paper; a mode which, although it does
not possess any remarkable novelty, seems to me
deserving of being made generally known, from
its giving a uniformity of results which may at all
times be depended upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>{325}</span></p>

<p>Independently of the very rich and agreeable
tones which may be produced by the process which
I am about to describe, it has the property of
affording permanent pictures, not liable to that
change by time to which pictures produced by the
use of the ammonio-nitrate solution are certainly
liable. I have upon all occasions advocated the
economical practice of photography, and the
present process will be found of that character;
but at the same time I can assure your readers
that a rapidity of action and intensity are hereby
obtained with a 40-grain solution of nitrate of
silver, fully equal to those gained from solutions
of 120, or even 200, grains to the ounce, as is frequently
practised.</p>

<p>In eight ounces of water (distilled or not) dissolve
forty grains of common salt, and the same
quantity of muriate of ammonia.<a name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Mix this solution
with eight ounces of albumen; beat<a name="footnotetag7" href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> the
whole well together, allow it to stand in tall
vessel from twenty-four to forty hours, when the
clear liquor may be poured off into a porcelain
dish rather larger than the paper intended to be
albumenized.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the best paper for this process,
and relative quantity of chemicals, is the <i>thin</i>
Canson Frères' but a much cheaper, and perhaps
equally suitable paper, is that made by Towgood
of St. Neots. Neither with Whatman's nor
Turner's papers, excellent as they are for some
processes, have I obtained such satisfactory results.
If the photographer should unfortunately possess
some of the thick paper of any inferior makers,
he had far better throw it away than waste his
chemicals, time, and temper upon the vain endeavour
to turn it to any good account.</p>

<p>The paper, having first been marked on the
right-hand upper corner of the smooth side, is
then to be floated with that marked side on the
albumen. This operation, which is very easy to
perform, is somewhat difficult to describe. I will
however try. Take the marked corner of the
sheet in the right-hand, the opposite corner of the
lower side of the paper in the left; and bellying
out the sheet, let the lower end fall gently on to
the albumen. Then gradually let the whole sheet
fall, so as to press out before it any adherent particles
of air. If this has been carefully done, no
air-bubbles will have been formed. The presence
of an air-bubble may however soon be detected by
the puckered appearance, which the back of the
paper assumes in consequence. When this is the
case, the paper must be carefully raised, the bubble
dispersed, and the paper replaced. A thin paper
requires to float for three minutes on the albumen,
but a thicker one proportionably longer. At the
end of that time raise the marked corner with the
point of a blanket pin; then take hold of it with
the finger and thumb, and so raise the sheet
steadily and <i>very slowly</i>, that the albumen may
drain off at the lower left corner. I urge this
raising it very slowly, because air-bubbles are very
apt to form on the albumen by the sudden snatching
up of the paper.</p>

<p>Each sheet, as it is removed from the albumen,
is to be pinned up by the marked corner on a long
slip of wood, which must be provided for the purpose.
In pinning it up, be careful that the albumenized
side takes an inward curl, otherwise, from
there being two angles of incidence, streaks will
form from the middle of the paper. During the
drying, remove from time to time, with a piece of
blotting-paper, the drop of fluid which collects at
the lower corner of the paper.</p>

<p>In order to fix the albumen, it is necessary that
the paper should be ironed with an iron as hot as
can be used without singeing the paper. It should
be first ironed between blotting-paper, and when
the iron begins to cool, it may be applied directly
to the surface of each sheet.</p>

<p>To excite this paper it is only needful to float it
carefully from three to five minutes, in the same
way as it was floated on the albumen, upon a
solution of nitrate of silver of forty grains to the
ounce. Each sheet is then to be pinned up and
dried as before. It is scarcely necessary to add,
that this exciting process must be carried on by
the light of a lamp or candle.</p>

<p>This paper has the property of keeping good
for several days, if kept in a portfolio. It has also
the advantage of being very little affected by the
ordinary light of a room, so that it may be used
and handled in any apartment where the direct
light is not shining upon it; yet in a tolerably intense
light it prints much more rapidly than that
prepared with the ammonio-nitrate.</p>

<p>The picture should be fixed in a bath of saturated
solution of hypo. The hypo. never gets
discoloured, and should always be carefully preserved.
When a new bath is formed, it is well to
add forty grains of chloride of silver to every eight
ounces of the solution.</p>

<p>A beautiful violet or puce tint, with great
whiteness of the high lights, may be obtained by
using the following bath as a fixing solution:</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Formula for a fixing solution">
  <tr>
    <td>Hyposulphite of soda</td>
    <td class="ar">8</td>
    <td>ounces.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sel d'or</td>
    <td class="ar">7</td>
    <td>grains.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Iodide of silver</td>
    <td class="ar">10</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Water</td>
    <td class="ar">8</td>
    <td>ounces.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It may be as well to add, that although the nitrate
of silver solution used for exciting becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>{326}</span>
discoloured, it acts equally well, even when of a
dark brown colour; but it may always be deprived
of its colour, and rendered sufficiently pure
again, by filtering it through a little animal charcoal.</p>

<p>The addition of one drachm of acetic acid much
facilitates the easy application of the albumen to the
paper; but it is apt to produce the unpleasant redness
so often noticeable in photographs. The addition of
forty grains of chloride of barium to the two muriates,
yields a bistre tint, which is admired by some photographers.</p>

<p>Among various matters it is mentioned,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What rendered Nixon the most noticed was, that
the time when the battle of Bosworth Field was fought
between King Richard III. and King Henry VII., he
stopped his team on a sudden, and with his whip
pointing from one land to the other, cried 'Now Richard!
now Henry!' several times, till at last he said,
'Now Harry, get over that ditch and you gain the
day!'"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This the plough-holder related; it afterwards
proved to be true, and in consequence Robert was
required to attend Henry VII.'s court, where he
was "starved to death," owing to having been
locked in a room and forgotten. The Bosworth
Field prophecy, which has often been repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>{327}</span>
carries the time of Nixon's existence much
before the period named by <span class="sc">T. Hughes</span>, namely,
James I.'s reign.</p>

<p><i>Parochial Libraries</i> (Vol. viii., p. 62.).&mdash;There
is an extensive, and rather valuable, library attached
to St. Mary's Church, Bridgenorth, presented
to and for the use of the parishioners, by
Dean Stackhouse in 1750. It comprises some eight
hundred volumes, chiefly divinity. There are two
or three fine MSS. in the collection, one especially
worthy of notice. A splendidly illuminated Latin
MS., dated about 1460, engrossed upon vellum,
and extending to three hundred leaves (C. 62. in
the Catalogue). I noticed many fragments of
early MSS. bound up with Hebrew and Latin
editions of the Bible; and a portion of a remarkably
fine missal, forming the dexter cover of a
copy of Laertius <i>de Vita Philosophica</i> (4to. 1524).
Surely a society may be formed, having for its
object the rescuing, transcribing, and printing of
those scarcely noticed fragments. <span class="sc">Mr. Hales'</span>
plan appears perfectly feasible. I am convinced
much interesting matter would be brought to light,
if a little interest was excited on the subject.</p>

abstraction of those documents by an unknown
hand) used for a library of theological
works, placed there for the special behoof of the
neighbouring clergy. The collection is but a
small one; and is, I fear, not often troubled by those
for whose use it was designed.</p>

<p><i>St. Patrick's Purgatory</i> (Vol. vii., p. 552.).&mdash;Some
degree of doubt appearing to exist, by the
statement in p. 178. of the present volume, as to
the position of the <i>real</i> St. Patrick's Purgatory, I
send the following from Camden:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The <i>Liffey</i>," says he, "near unto his spring head,
enlarges his stream and spreads abroad into a <i>lake</i>,
wherein appears above the water an island, and in it,
hard by a little monastery, a very narrow vault within
the ground, much spoken of by reason of its religious
horrors. Which cave some say was dug by Ulysses
when he went down to parley with those in hell.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants," he continues, "term it in these
days <i>Ellan n' Frugadory</i>, that is, <i>The Isle of Purgatory</i>,
or <i>St. Patrick's Purgatory</i>. For some persons devoutly
credulous affirm that St. Patrick, the Irishmen's
apostle, or else some abbot of the same name, obtained
by most earnest prayer at the hands of God, that the
punishments and torments which the wicked are to
suffer after this life, might <i>here</i> be presented to the
eye; that so he might the more easily root out the
sins and heathenish errors which stuck so fast to his
countrymen the <i>Irish</i>."</p>

<span class="sc">W. St.</span> and <span class="sc">Gulielmus</span> replied to my Query,
I have discovered more particular information
regarding him. In a MS. in Trinity College,
Dublin, I find the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sir George Carr of Southerhall, Yorkshire, married,
on Jan. 15, 1637, Grissell, daughter of Sir Robert
Meredith, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Ireland;
their son, William Carr, born Jan. 11, 1639, married<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>{328}</span>
on August 29, 1665, Elizabeth, daughter of Francis
(Edward) Synge, Bishop of Cork. There were two
children of this marriage: Edward, born Oct. 7, 1671
(who died unmarried); and Barbara, born May 12,
1672; she married John Cliffe, Esq., of Mulrankin, co.
Wexford, and had several children, of whom the eldest,
John, was grandfather of the present Anthony Cliffe of
Bellevue, co. Wexford, Esq."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Edward Synge was Bishop of Cork from Dec.
1663 to his death in 1678.</p>

<p>Sir George Carr appears to be the son of William
Carr, the eldest son of James Carr of Yorkshire:
see Harl. MS. 1487, 451.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Meredith, father of Lady Carr, married
Anne, daughter of Sir William Upton, Clerk
of the Council in Ireland.</p>

<p><i>Gravestone Inscription</i> (Vol. viii., p. 268.).&mdash;The
gravestone inscription communicated by
<span class="sc">Julia R. Bockett</span> consists of the last four lines of
the ballad of "Death and the Lady" (see Dixon's
<i>Ballads</i>, by the Percy Society). They should
be:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <p>"The grave's the market-place where all men meet,</p>
    <p>Both rich and poor, as well as small and great:</p>
    <p>If life were merchandise that gold could buy,</p>
    <p>The rich would live, the poor alone would die."</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the introduction to Smith's edition of Holbein's
<i>Dance of Death</i>, the editor says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The concluding lines have been converted into an
epitaph, <i>to be found in most of our village churchyards</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Of the truth of which assertion the churchyard
of Milton-next-Gravesend, in Kent, furnishes an
illustration, as I copied the lines from a stone
there some years ago. Being generally, I imagine,
quoted from memory, they do not appear to be
exactly similar in any two instances.</p>

<p>"<i>A Tub to the Whale</i>" (Vol. viii., pp. 220. 304.).&mdash;I
observe that a Querist, <span class="sc">Pimlico</span>, asks the origin
of the phrase to "throw a tub to the whale." I
think an explanation of this will be found in the
introduction to Swift's <i>Tale of the Tub</i>. I cannot
lay my hand on the passage, but it is to the effect
that sailors engaged in the Greenland fisheries
make it a practice to throw over-board a <i>tub</i> to a
wounded whale, to divert his attention from the
boat which contains his assailants.</p>

<p><i>Hour-glasses in Pulpits</i> (Vol. vii., p. 489.;
Vol. viii., pp. 82. 209.).&mdash;Whilst turning over the
pages of Macaulay's <i>History</i>, I accidentally stumbled
upon the following passage, which forms an
interesting addition to the Notes already collected
in your pages. Speaking of Gilbert
Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He was often interrupted by the deep hum of his
audience; and when, after preaching out the hour-glass,
which in those days was part of the furniture of the
pulpit, he held it in his hand, the congregation clamorously
encouraged him to go on till the sand had
run off once more."&mdash;Macaulay's <i>History</i>, vol. ii.
p. 177. edit. 8., with a reference in a foot-note to
Speaker Onslow's Note on <i>Burnet</i>, i. 596.; Johnson's
<i>Life of Sprat</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The hour-glass stand at St. Alban's, Wood
Street, appears to be a remarkable example: see
Sperling's <i>Church Walks in Middlesex</i>, p. 155., and
Allen's <i>Lambeth</i>. And in the report of the
meeting of the Archæological Association at Rochester,
in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> of the 6th
August, 1853, it is noted that in the church at
Cliff, "the pulpit has an hour-glass stand dated
1636:" the date gives an additional interest to this
example.</p>

<p><i>Slow-worm Superstition</i> (Vol. viii., p. 33.).&mdash;The
slow-worm superstition, about which <span class="sc">Tower</span>
inquires, and to whom I believe no answer has
been returned, is quite common in the North of
England. One of the many uses of "N. &amp; Q." is
the abundant proof that supposed localisms are in
fact common to all England. I learn from the
same Number, p. 44., that in Devonshire a slater
is called a <i>hellier</i>. <i>To hill</i>, that is to cover, "hill
me up," <i>i. e.</i> cover me up, is as common in Lancashire
as in Wicliff's Bible. We have not, however,
<i>hellier</i> or <i>hillier</i> for one whose business it is
to cover in a house.</p>

<p><i>Sincere</i> (Vol. viii., p. 195.).&mdash;I should be glad
if <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> would point out any authority for
the practice of the Roman potters to which he
refers. The only passage I can call to mind as
countenancing his derivation is Hor. <i>Ep.</i> i. 2. 54.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sincerum est nisi vas, quodcumque infundis, acescit."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>in which there is no reason why <i>sincerum</i> should
not be simply <i>sine cera</i>, <i>sine fuco</i>, i. e. pure as
honey, free or freed from the wax, thence anything
pure. This derivation is supported also by
Donatus, ad Ter. <i>Eun.</i> i. 2. 97., and Noltenius, <i>Lex.
Antibar</i>. Cicero also, who chose his expressions
with great accuracy, employs <i>sincerus</i> as directly
opposed to <i>fucatus</i> in his <i>Dialogus de Amicit.</i> 25.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Secernere omnis fucata et simulata a sinceris atque
veris."</p>

in the account of the church at Whitchurch (<i>alias</i>
Little Stanmore), that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Many of the prayer books, given by the duke [of
Chandos], still remain chained to the pues for the use
of the poorer parishioners."&mdash;P. 104.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>At p. 138. a curious ornament of some of the
London churches is referred to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We find several altar-pieces in which seven wooden
candlesticks, with wooden candles, are introduced, viz.
St. Mary-at-Hill; St. Ethelburgs, Bishopsgate; Hammersmith,
&amp;c.: these are merely typical of the seven
golden candlesticks of the Apocalypse."&mdash;Rev. i. 20.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This portion of ecclesiastical furniture appears
to me sufficiently unusual to be worth noting in
your pages: is it to be found elsewhere than in
churches in and near London? If not, a list of
these churches in which it is now to be seen would
be acceptable to ecclesiologists.</p>

<p><i>Wood of the Cross</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 177. 334. 437.

of four different kinds of wood? Boys, in a
note on Ephesians iii. 18. (<i>Works</i>, p. 495.), says,
"Other have discoursed of the foure woods, and
dimensions in the materiall crosse of Christ, more
subtilly than soundly," and refers in the margin to
Anselm and Aquinas, but without giving the reference
to the exact passages. Can any of your

<p><i>Ladies' Arms in a Lozenge</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 37. 83.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Broctuna</span>
has a theory that ladies bear their arms
in a lozenge, because hatchments are of that shape;
and it is probably that widows in old time "would
vie with each other in these displays of the insignia
of mourning." It has, however, escaped his
memory, that maids with living fathers also use
the lozenge, and that in a man's hatchment it is
the <i>frame</i> only, and not the shield at all, which
has the lozenge shape. The man's arms in the
hatchment not being on a lozenge, it is scarcely
possible his widow could thence have adopted it.
He suggests that the shape was adopted for hatchments
as being the most convenient for admitting the
arms of the sixteen ancestors.</p>

<p>I wish to insert a Query, as to whether the sixteen
quarters <i>ever were</i> made use of this way in
English heraldry? Perhaps your readers will be
willing to allow that the lozenge is surely a fitting
emblem for the <i>sweeter</i> sex; but is not the routine
reason the true one after all? The lozenge has a
supposed resemblance to the distaff, the emblem of
the woman. We have spinster from the same idea;
and, though I cannot now turn to the passage, I
am sure I have seen the Salic law described as
forbidding "the holder of the distaff to grasp the
sceptre."</p>

<p><i>Burial in unconsecrated Ground</i> (Vol. vi., p. 448.;
Vol. viii., p. 43.).&mdash;The late elegant and accomplished
Sir W. Temple, though he laid not his
whole body in his garden, deposited the better
part of it (his heart) there; "and if my executors
will gratify me in what I have desired, I wish my
corpse may be interred as I have bespoke them;
not at all out of singularity, or for want of a dormitory
(of which there is an ample one annexed
to the parish church), but for other reasons not
necessary here to trouble the reader with, what I
have said in general being sufficient. However,
let them order as they think fit, so it be not <i>in the
church or chancel</i>." (Evelyn's <i>Sylva</i>, book iv.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the north aisle of the chancel [of Wotton
Church] is the burying-place of the Evelyns (within
which is lately made, under a decent arched chapel, a
vault). In the chancel on the north side is a tomb,
about three feet high, of freestone, shaped like a coffin;
on the top, on white marble, is this inscription:</p>

there is no modern discovery that was not known,
in some shape or other, to the ancients, it seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>{330}</span>
not unreasonable to suppose that table-turning,
the principle of which lies so near the surface of
social life, was practised in former ages.</p>

<p>This reminds one of the expression, so familiar
among controversialists, of "turning the tables"
upon an adversary. What is the origin of the
latter phrase? It is time some explanation of it
were offered, if only to caution the etymologists
of a future age against confounding it with our
"table-turning."</p>

<p><i>"Well's a fret"</i> (Vol. viii., p. 197.).&mdash;I beg
leave to suggest to <span class="sc">Devoniensis</span> the following as
a probable explanation of the use of this phrase;
the rhyme that follows being superadded, for the
sake of the jingle and the truism, in the best style
of rustic humour.</p>

<p>Well! is often used in conversation as an expletive,
even by educated people, a slight pause
ensuing after the ejaculation, as if to collect the
thoughts before the reply is given. Is it not
therefore called a <i>fret</i>, or stop, in the Devon
vernacular, figuratively, like the fret or stop in
a musical instrument, the cross bars or protuberance
in a stringed, and a peg in a wind instrument?</p>

<p>Hamlet says, in taunting Rosencrantz for his
treasonable attempts to worm himself into his confidence,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Call me what instrument you will; though you
can <i>fret</i> me, you cannot play upon me."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Taken in this other sense in which we use the
word <i>fret</i>, is it not probable that it has passed into
a proverb; and that the lines, as given by <span class="sc">Devoniensis</span>,
are a corruption of</p>

<div class="poem">

<p><i>Tenet for Tenent</i> (Vol. viii., p. 258.).&mdash;The note
of your correspondent <span class="sc">Balliolensis</span> does not
address itself to the Query put by Y. B. N. J. in
Vol. vii., p. 205., When did the use of <i>tenent</i>
give way to <i>tenet</i>?</p>

<p>You will find that Burton, in the <i>Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>, which was published in 1621, uses
uniformly <i>tenent</i> (vide vol. i. pp. 1. 317. 408. 430.
446. &amp;c.)</p>

<p>But Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, twenty-four
years later, printed the first edition of his <i>Vulgar
Errors</i> under the title of <i>Pseudodoxia epidemica,
or Enquiries into very many received Tenets and
commonly presumed Truths</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot find that Burton in any passage respects
the grammatical distinction suggested by both
your correspondents, that <i>tenet</i> should denote the
opinion of an individual, and <i>tenent</i> those of a sect.
He applies the latter indifferently, both as regards
the plural and singular. Thus, "Aponensis thinks
it proceeds," but "Laurentius condemns <i>his
tenent</i>" (part i. sect. iii. mem. 3.). And again,
"they are furious, impatient in discourse, stiff
and irrefragable in <i>their tenents</i>" (ib. p. i. s. iv.
mem. 1. sub. 3.).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dr. Wurzer's Testimonial.</i></p>

<p class="right">"Bonn, July 19, 1852.</p>

<p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the
most excellent, nourishing, and restorative
remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful
in confined habit of body, as also diarrhœa,
bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory
irritation and cramp of the urethra, cramp of
the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and hemorrhoids.
This really invaluable remedy is employed
with the most satisfactory result, not
only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
where irritation and pain are to be removed,
but also in pulmonary and bronchial consumption,
in which it counteracts effectually the
troublesome cough; and I am enabled with
perfect truth to express the conviction that Du
Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the
cure of incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>

Part I. By the Rev. S. R. MAITLAND,
D.D. F.R.S. F.S.A. Sometime Librarian to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury, and Keeper
of the MSS. at Lambeth.</p>

<p>"One of the most valuable and interesting
pamphlets we ever read."&mdash;<i>Morning Herald.</i></p>

<p>"This publication, which promises to be the
commencement of a larger work, will well
repay serious perusal."&mdash;<i>Ir. Eccl. Journ.</i></p>

<p>"A small pamphlet in which he throws
startling light on the practices of modern
Mesmerism."&mdash;<i>Nottingham Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. Maitland, we consider, has here brought
Mesmerism to the 'touchstone of truth,' to the
test of the standard of right or wrong. We
thank him for this first instalment of his inquiry,
and hope that he will not long delay
the remaining portions."&mdash;<i>London Medical
Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"The Enquiries are extremely curious, we
should indeed say important. That relating
to the Witch of Endor is one of the most successful
we ever read. We cannot enter into
particulars in this brief notice, but we would
strongly recommend the pamphlet even to
those who care nothing about Mesmerism, or
<i>angry</i> (for it has come to this at last) with the
subject."&mdash;<i>Dublin Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>"We recommend its general perusal as being
really an endeavour, by one whose position
gives him the best facilities, to ascertain the
genuine character of Mesmerism, which is so
much disputed."&mdash;<i>Woolmer's Exeter Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Dr. Maitland has bestowed a vast deal of
attention on the subject for many years past,
and the present pamphlet is in part the result
of his thoughts and inquiries. There is a good
deal in it which we should have been glad to
quote ... but we content ourselves with referring
our readers to the pamphlet itself."&mdash;<i>Brit.
Mag.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
